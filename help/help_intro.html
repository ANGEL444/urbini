          <td><p class="text">We currently use email, phone and fax for all the 
              job planning, definition and revision information from customers. 
              If you're a member of the a production planning email groups you 
              will know how many pieces of information make up a job and how many 
              revisions come through. Keeping track of the latest updates, making 
              sure they have been actioned by someone and having all the information 
              to hand has been a time consuming but critical task for everyone 
              involved. </p>
            <p class="text" align="justify">The intranet (Vantage) is mainly a 
              read only monitoring, reporting and analysis web tool for us and 
              the customers. We are introducing a new dimension to Vantage enabling 
              better collaboration between print site operations and customers. 
              MRM is a new web platform which will enable us to change the way 
              we interact with customers &amp; colleagues. (In case you're wondering, 
              MRM stands for Multi-media Relationship Management. The buzz word 
              in business at the moment is CRM which means Customer Relationship 
              Management, but MRM goes way beyond this fixed boundary.)</p>
            <p class="text" align="justify">The initial goals for MRM are as follows:<br>
              1 Standardise the print notices, instructions and acknowledgements 
              we handle with customers<br>
              2 Standardise the special care notice procedure for customers and 
              printers<br>
              3 Centralise issue management relating to a job whether they are 
              publisher, production or print issues<br>
              4 Manage print test and trial procedures, reporting and operations<br>
            </p>
            <p class="text" align="justify">MRM allows production and the customers 
              to track changes and see who changed what, and when. It allows management 
              and the printers to have all the relevant information to hand instantly, 
              the moment it's happened. </p>
            <p class="text" align="justify">You will start to see some new icons 
              on the Vantage Web Pages where you can drill into MRM Issues, Print 
              Notices, Print Trials and Special Care Notices. The links will appear 
              on the issue report, future scheduled jobs and the press running 
              screen. These links are for read only access but the full system 
              is available via a login.</p>
            <p class="text" align="justify">The links to the left will guide you 
              through using MrM so please read them all.</p>
