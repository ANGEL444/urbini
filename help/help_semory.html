          <td><p class="text">MrM has a huge number of features and tools which 
              are all explained in this help site. All the types of information 
              stored will have the same screen layout. Once you've mastered one 
              view you will recognise any view of information in MrM.</p>
            <p class="text">There are two basic views; lists of items and individual 
              item details. All lists allow you to drill into the items to see 
              the details. Changes made to Items are tracked and users can comment 
              against any item.</p>
            <p class="text">MrM is a store of any type of information whether 
              it's simple text or an attachment of any kind. Everything stored 
              can be found using a powerful reporting filter tool or by simply 
              searching for text.</p>
            <p class="text">MrM is integrated with Vantage to enable seamless 
              links to job information. You can see items related to a job via 
              the links on the issue report. You can also see current items for 
              today and tomorrow by simple links from the schedule.</p>
            <p class="text">MrM is based on the combined technologies of databases 
              and the semantic web. A new term has been given to this platform; 
              semory, meaning semantic memory. It understands what it stores and 
              how it relates to other things it already stores or knows. It's 
              an active storage system so it can alert or email you when things 
              happen that you are interested in. It also introduces a new era 
              of rapid development. Effectively there is no need to develop in 
              code just define what you want to store and how it relates to other 
              things it already knows. </p>
