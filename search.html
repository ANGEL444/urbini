    HudsonFog offers full-text search and property-based search.

    <h3>Full-text Search</h3>
    This is a traditional keyword-based search common on the Web. We index HTML, text documents as well as Office documents like Excel spreadsheets. We use a powerful and very flexible search engine <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/">Lucene.</a>

    <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td class="big-heading">Search site:</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            <form name="searchForm" method="get" action="searchResult.html?JLANG=en">
              <input type="text" name="q" size="15" maxlength="255" value="" /><input type="submit" name="search" value="Go" />
            </form>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
