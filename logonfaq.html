    <h1>Logon FAQ</h1>

    <h3>I cannot seem to be able to log on, what am I doing wrong?</h3>

    Both user name and password are case sensitive. Please make sure that your "Caps Lock" is off and try to type in your user name and password again. If a problem persists please contact the administrator of the site you are trying to log on to, or our technical support department at <a href="mailto:support@hudsonfog.com">support@hudsonfog.com</a>.

    <h3>I try to log on and see the message that my session has expired. What do I do?</h3>

    The site you were on automatically logged you out after you have been inactive for a while. Just go ahead and try to log on again.

    <h3>I log on and see the following message - "User name is missing".</h3>

    Apparently you forgot to type in your user name. Please try to log on again. If a problem persists please contact the administrator of the site you are trying to log on to, or our technical support department at <a href="mailto:support@hudsonfog.com">support@hudsonfog.com</a>.

    <h3>I log on successfully, but all I see is the message saying that I am not permitted to enter here.</h3>

    Apparently you do not have enough access rights to view certain types of resources on the site you logged on to. Please contact the site's administrator to check your access rights.
